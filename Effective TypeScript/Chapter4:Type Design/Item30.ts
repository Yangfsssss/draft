/** Item30: 不要在文档中重复类型信息，Don't Repeat Type Information in Documentation */

//Things to Remember
//• Avoid repeating type information in comments and variable names. In the best
//case it is duplicative of type declarations, and in the worst it will lead to conflicting information.
//• Consider including units in variable names if they aren’t clear from the type (e.g.,timeMs or temperatureC).
