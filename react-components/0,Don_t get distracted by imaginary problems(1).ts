//linter problems:
//1,Linter as an overzealous noisy gatekeeper rather than a helpful tool.
//2,People don’t learn to differentiate between valid and invalid uses of a certain pattern.
//3,People get opinionated about things that don’t bring a meaningful difference.

//conclusion:
//Get a good linter config,don't focus on the style too much.

//reset your lint config:
//find actually useful ones rather than the 'best practices'

//formatting:
//1:plain formatting:tools like Prettier
//2:code style needs to be consistent:linter

//what is actually important:
//how code work than it look.

//component design principles:
//1,Don't stop the data flow.
//2,Always be ready to render.
//3,No component is a singleton.
//4,Keep the local state isolated.
