/** Managing State */

//As your application grows, it helps to be more intentional about how your state is organized and how the data flows between your components. 
//Redundant or duplicate state is a common source of bugs. 
//In this chapter, you’ll learn how to structure your state well, how to keep your state update logic maintainable, and how to share state between distant components.

//Reacting to input with state
//In React,you describe the UI you want to see for the different visual states of your component (“initial state”, “typing state”, “success state”), 
//and then trigger the state changes in response to user input.
